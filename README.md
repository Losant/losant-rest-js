# Losant Javascript REST API Client

![Build Status](https://github.com/Losant/losant-rest-js/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/losant-rest.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/losant-rest)

The [Losant](https://www.losant.com) REST API client provides a simple way to use the comprehensive Losant API. You can authenticate either as a Losant device or with your user account, and have access to all the functionality of the Losant platform.

This client works both in browsers and node.js (v0.12 and newer), and supports both callbacks and promises. It uses [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) under the covers for the actual HTTP communication.

<br/>

## Installation

The latest stable version is available in NPM and can be installed using

```bash
npm install --save losant-rest
```

<br/>

## Example

Below is a high-level example of using the Losant JavaScript REST API client to authenticate against the Losant Platform and report state for a device.

```javascript
var api = require('losant-rest');
var mySensor = require('./my-analog-sensor');

var client = api.createClient();

client.auth.authenticateDevice({ credentials: {
  deviceId: 'my-device-id',
  key: 'my-app-access-key',
  secret: 'my-app-access-secret'
}}).then(function (response) {
  client.setOption('accessToken', response.token);
  var appId = response.applicationId;

  var state = { data: { temperature: mySensor.read() } };
  return client.device.sendState({
    deviceId: 'my-device-id',
    applicationId: appId,
    deviceState: state
  });
})
.then(function (response) {
  console.log(response); // { success: true }
})
.catch(function (error) {
  console.error(error);
});
```

<br/>

## API Documentation

```javascript
var client = api.createClient({ accessToken: undefined, url: 'https://api.losant.com' })
```

The losant-rest module exposes a single function named createClient which
returns a client instance. It takes the following options:

* accessToken  
  The access token to be used for authentication - by default there is no access token. An access token can be acquired through any of the [Auth](docs/auth.md) methods, or can be created for a particular application through [applicationApiTokens](docs/applicationApiTokens.md).

* url  
  The url of the Losant API - by default <https://api.losant.com>.

### Client

A client is a single api instance. By default, it is unauthenticated, but can be given an access token to perform authenticated requests.

#### Functions

* setOption(name, value)  
  The setOption function can be used to change any of the options currently set on the client, such as the access token.

* getOption(name)  
  The getOption function can be used to retrieve the current value of any of the options set on the client instance.
